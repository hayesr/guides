## i18n implementation

ManageIQ uses [gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext) for internationalization.
In particular, the project uses the following gems to make internationalization work:

* [gettext](http://ruby-gettext.github.io)
* [fast_gettext](https://github.com/grosser/fast_gettext)
* [gettext_i18n_rails](https://github.com/grosser/gettext_i18n_rails)
* [gettext_i18n_rails_js](https://github.com/webhippie/gettext_i18n_rails_js)
* [rails-i18n](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n)

## Gettext usage

ManageIQ supports internationalization of strings in ruby and haml sources as well as JavaScript.

### Ruby / HAML

The following gettext routines are supported in Ruby and HAML sources:

* `_(msgid)` - translates `msgid` and returns the translated string
  * [rubydoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gettext/GetText#gettext-instance_method)
* `N_(msgid)` - dynamic translation: this will put `msgid` in the gettext catalog but the string will not be translated by gettext at this time (see delayed translation below)
  * [rubydoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gettext/GetText#N_-instance_method)
* `n(msgid, msgid_plural, n)` - returns either translated `msgid` or its translated plural form (`msgid_plural`) depending on `n`, a number determining the count (i.e. number above 1 means plural form)
  * [rubydoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gettext/GetText#ngettext-instance_method)
* `s_(msgid, seperator = "|")` - translates `msgid`, but if there are no localized text, it returns a last part of `msgid` separated by `separator` (`|` by default)
  * [rubydoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gettext/GetText#sgettext-instance_method)
* `ns_(msgid, msgid_plural, n, seperator = "|")` - similar to the `n_()`, but if there is no localized text, it returns a last part of `msgid` separated by `separator`.
  * [rubydoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gettext/GetText#ngettext-instance_method)

### JavaScript

Internationalization in JavaScript is done with `gettext_i18n_rails_js` gem. The gem extends `gettext_i18n_rails` making the `.po` files available to client side javascript as JSON files.

Unlike ruby / haml sources, javascript uses `__()` (i.e. two underscores rather than one) to invoke gettext. This is done to avoid conflicts with other javascript modules.

The gettext routines supported in javascript sources:

* `__(msgid)`
* `n_(msgid, msgid_plural, n)`
* `s_(msgid)`

The semantic is similar to the ruby equivalents.

### Angular applications

Purely Angular applications, such as Self-Service UI, use [gettext-angular](https://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/) for internationalization.
The `gettext-angular` module allows for annotating parts of the angular application (html of javascript), which need to be translated.

Guides for annotating content:

* [html files](https://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/dev-guide/annotate/)
* [javascript files](https://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/dev-guide/annotate-js/)

Note, that in Self-Service UI, thanks to

* [N_ alias](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/blob/master/spa_ui/self_service/client/app/config/gettext.config.js#L20)
* [__ alias](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/blob/master/spa_ui/self_service/client/app/config/gettext.config.js#L21)

we can use `N_()` and `__()` in javascript sources instead of regular `angular-gettext` routines (`gettext` and `gettextCatalog.getString`).

### Delayed / dynamic translations

Sometimes we need to delay translation of a string to a later time. For example menu items and sections or certain tree nodes are defined once but then need to be rendered many times possibly in different locales.

In the simplest case you can use `N_('bar')` saying "do not translate this string" such as:

```
menu_item = Menu::Item.new(N_('Cloud Tennants')
```

and such strings will be caught by the `rake gettext:find` task so these strings end up in the catalog.
Then you do the translation when needed (e.g. when generating the HTML or JSON format of the data) by calling `_()` such as:

```
menu_item_text = _(menu_item.text)
```

To properly internationalize a string with interpolation that needs to be translated at render time rather than right away, use `PostponedTranslation` class.

```
tip = PostponedTranslation.new( _N("%s Alert Profiles") ) { "already translated string" }
```

and then in the place where the value is used you will have:

```
translated_tip = tip.kind_of?(Proc) ? tip.call : _(tip)
```

### String interpolation

Whenever you need to use string interpolation inside a gettext call, you need to follow several rules.

* different languages might have different word orders so we use named placeholders:

```
_("%{model} \"%{name}\" was added") % {:model => ui_lookup(:model=>"MiqReport"), :name => @rpt.name}
```

These forms are not acceptable:

```
_("%s (All %s)" % [@ems_cluster.name, title_for_hosts]) # the name of the placeholder can provide vital information to the translator
_("No %s were selected to move up") % "fields"          # use named placeholder even in the case of a single placeholder
```

* do not use variables inside gettext strings as these will not be extracted and placed in the gettext catalog

Incorrect:

```
text = "Some random text"
_(text)
```

Correct:

```
_("Some random text")
```

### Marking gettext strings in UI

To be able to see strings which pass through gettext (i.e. are translatable), you have to add the following to the servers advanced settings:

```
ui:
  mark_translated_strings: true
```
and restart the ManageIQ application. With these settings on, all strings passing through gettext will be marked with `»` and `«` markers:

```
»webui text that went through some of the gettext routines«
```


## Translating ManageIQ

To contribute with translation to ManageIQ, create an account at [zanata](translate.zanata.org)
and navigate to [ManageIQ project page](https://translate.zanata.org/zanata/project/view/manageiq)

### Translator notes

* How do I translate keys in the form of `Hardware|Usage`? What do they mean?
`Hardware|Usage` means Usage in namespace Hardware. This is the way we translate model attributes for ActiveRecord models for example. You do not have to translate "Hardware", just translate "Usage".

* what does the key `locale_name` mean?
`local_name` meens name of the given language in the language itself. Such as "Deutsch" for German or "Česky" for Czech. Make sure to provide the value for this key, without it the language/locale cannot be presented in the UI.


## Updating translations (developers)

The workflow for updating translations is:

* Update gettext catalogs in ManageIQ git repository. This is done to make sure the gettext catalog contains up to date (i.e. current) strings for translators. This part entails several steps.

First, comment out `config.eager_load_paths = []` in `config/application.rb`

Next, update `config/model_attributes.rb` to reflect current status. From the root of ManageIQ checkout, run the following:

```
$ bundle exec rake gettext:store_model_attributes
```

Next, extract strings from `en.yml` and various other yaml files. From the root of ManageIQ checkout, run the following:
```
$ bundle exec rake locale:store_dictionary_strings
$ bundle exec rake locale:extract_yaml_strings
```

Next, update gettext catalog by running:

```
$ bundle exec rake gettext:find
```

Next, revert unneeded changes and clean up unnecessary files:

```
$ git reset config/application.rb
$ git clean -f
```

Now, commit and push changed files into git (branch, pull request, etc.). Make sure no other files than the following list is commited:

```
config/model_attributes.rb
config/dictionary_strings.rb
config/yaml_strings.rb
config/locales/manageiq.pot
config/locales/*/*.po
```

* Upload the catalog created in previous step to [zanata](http://translate.zanata.org). You need to be maintainer of ManageIQ project at [zanata](http://translate.zanata.org)

Before commencing with this step, make sure you have `zanata-cli` installed and configured ([documentation](http://zanata.org/help/)

To upload the catalog to zanata, run the following:

```
$ cd config/locales
$ zanata-cli push --push-type source
```

Now translators in zanata will have the latest stuff to translate available.

* Once the translators finish translations of a particular language, pull the translated catalog from zanata back to ManageIQ repository.

Run the following in ManageIQ git checkout:

```
$ cd config/locales
$ zanata-cli pull --pull-type trans    # add --locales ... if you wish to download only specific locales
$ bundle exec rake gettext:po_to_json
```

If you are adding new locales / languages to ManageIQ, don't forget to create yaml file containing localized names of each included
language. From the root of ManageIQ checkout, run the following:

```
$ bundle exec rake locale:extract_locale_names
```

This will update `config/human_locale_names.yaml` file.

Now commit and push the changes (branch, pull request, etc.). Make sure no other files than the following list is commited:

```
config/locales/*/*.po
app/assets/javascripts/locale/*/*.js
config/human_locale_names.yaml        # optionally, if you added locales
```
